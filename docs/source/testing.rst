Running Tests
*************

Running Tests From the CLI
==========================
Test modules are designed to be run from the root folder with the command ``python -m pytest``.

* To view the logging statements with the default logging levels (``warning`` for running tests, ``debug`` for showing errors) in the pytest output, add ``-s`` to the command. (The ``-s`` flag is for showing standard terminal output, but it also gets all columns of dataframes to display.)
* To view logging statements with a specified logging level in the pytest output when running tests, add ``-s --log-cli-level="LEVEL"`` to the command where ``LEVEL`` is the name of the desired logging level. 
* To save the pytest output to stdout, add ``-p pytest_session2file --session2file=logfile_name`` to the command, where ``logfile_name`` is the name of the logfile, including the file extension and the relative path from the root folder (the folder in which the command is being run) for the desired location.

  * In stdout, the test functions are reproduced until the point of the error, at which point the error is stated; in the log files, these reproductions contain a fair number of extra characters with no discernable meaning that can be removed by replacing the regex ``\[[\d;]*m`` with no characters.
  * Pytest has a built-in argument for saving logging to a file, but it saves only the logging; the session2file extension copies the complete pytest output to stdout, including the stack trace.

* To run the tests in a single module, end the command with the path from the root directory (which is the present working directory) to the module.

Working with the Database Within the Container
==============================================
In addition to the established tests, it's possible to interact with the data through the MySQL command line via the command ``mysql -h ${DATABASE_HOST} -u ${DATABASE_USERNAME} -p${DATABASE_PASSWORD} ${DATABASE_SCHEMA_NAME}`` (with environment variable substitutions as appropriate). The data can also be viewed using SQLAlchemy on Python's command line within the NoLCAT container:

1. Enter the Python command line with ``python``
2. Import the needed SQLAlchemy methods with ``from sqlalchemy import create_engine`` and ``from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker``
3. Import the variables used in the engine with ``from nolcat.app import *`` when entering the Python CLI from the main "nolcat" folder
4. Initialize the engine object with ``engine = create_engine(f'mysql://{DATABASE_USERNAME}:{DATABASE_PASSWORD}@{DATABASE_HOST}:{DATABASE_PORT}/{DATABASE_SCHEMA_NAME}')``
5. Create a factory for session objects (sessionmaker) with ``Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)``
6. Initialize a session object with ``session = Session()``
7. Run any given SQL query with ``session.execute("SQL").fetchall()`` where ``SQL`` is the SQL statement

With an initialized session, it's possible to display the relations as dataframes:

1. Import pandas with ``import pandas as pd``
2. Initialize a variable ``relation`` with the name of the relation to be displayed
3. Initialize a list for the field names with ``field_names=[]``
4. Start the loop to get the field names with ``for field in session.execute(f"DESCRIBE {relation};").fetchall():``
5. Write the iteration to get the field names with a tab followed by ``field_names.append(field[0])``
6. Create the dataframe with ``df=pd.DataFrame(session.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {relation};"),columns=field_names)``
7. Set the index with ``df=df.set_index(field_names[0])`` or, for relations with multiindexes, ``df=df.set_index([field_names[0], field_names[1]])``

Test Data
*********
Since this application is about data--its collection, storage, organization, and retrieval--many parts of the application require sample data for testing. To that end, a set of sample test data is included in this repo, along with information about how it was constructed.

Test Data Folders and Modules
=============================

"\\tests\\bin\\"
----------------
This folder contains all the Excel files, most of which are stored in one of three subfolders:

* "\\tests\\bin\\COUNTER_workbooks_for_tests\\": The workbooks in this folder follow the formatting and naming rules for COUNTER reports to be uploaded. Any test related to COUNTER data ingest functionality will be getting their data from this folder.
* "\\tests\\bin\\sample_COUNTER_R4_reports\\": This folder contains all the R4 COUNTER reports used for testing sorted into workbooks by report type.
* "\\tests\\bin\\sample_COUNTER_R5_reports\\": This folder contains all the R4 COUNTER reports used for testing sorted into workbooks by report type.
* "\\tests\\bin\\workbooks_to_transform_into_JSONs\\": This folder contains all the Excel workbooks transformed by "tests\\data\\create_JSON_base.json" for use as input for "tests\\create_SUSHI_JSON_from_tabular_R5.py".


"\\tests\\data\\relations.py"
-----------------------------
This module contains the functions:

* ``fiscalYears_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `fiscalYears` relation.
* ``annualStatistics_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `annualStatistics` relation.
* ``vendors_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `vendors` relation.
* ``vendorNotes_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `vendorNotes` relation.
* ``statisticsSources_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `statisticsSources` relation.
* ``statisticsSourceNotes_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `statisticsSourceNotes` relation.
* ``resourceSources_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `resourceSources` relation.
* ``resourceSourceNotes_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `resourceSourceNotes` relation.
* ``statisticsResourceSources_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `statisticsResourceSources` relation.
* ``annualUsageCollectionTracking_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `annualUsageCollectionTracking` relation.
* ``COUNTERData_relation()``: The dataframe of test data for the `COUNTERData` relation.

Creating the Test Data
======================
All test data provided in this repository is based on actual COUNTER reports where the numbers have been changed for confidentiality and many of the resources have been removed for speed. The retained resources were selected to ensure as many edge cases as possible were accounted for.

* R4 data is based off tabular data in the workbooks in "\\tests\\bin\\sample_COUNTER_R4_reports"
* R5 data is based off tabular data in the workbooks in "\\tests\\bin\\sample_COUNTER_R5_reports"
* R5.1 data is based off JSON responses from SUSHI calls made in browser in "\\tests\\data\\R5.1_COUNTER_JSONs_for_tests"

The modifications to turn the above data sources into the various forms needed for all testing purposes are described below. COUNTER data eligible for SUSHI and manual harvest is sourced in a single format and transformed to the other format because COUNTER R5 data providers have been known to provide different data in tabular and JSON COUNTER reports pulled at nearly the same time with the same date range and parameters.

In the test data, the ``statistics_source_ID`` values are as follows

* ProQuest = 0
* EBSCO = 1
* Gale = 2
* Duke UP = 3

Create R4 and R5 Test Data
--------------------------

Create Tabular COUNTER Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Gather COUNTER reports from a small number of statistics sources and remove most of the resources, keeping as many edge cases as possible.
2. Change all non-zero usage numbers in the COUNTER reports for confidentiality, making them safe to add to the public repo.
3. Save all the COUNTER reports in the "\\tests\\bin\\COUNTER_workbooks_for_tests\\" folder, using the workbook and worksheet naming conventions required by "\\nolcat\\upload_COUNTER_data.py".

Create `COUNTERData` Relations Fixture Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. For each workbook in "\\tests\\bin\\COUNTER_workbooks_for_tests\\", load its worksheets into OpenRefine to create projects.
2. Use the notebook at "\\tests\\create_test_data\\COUNTER_tabular_to_dataframe.ipynb" to create a "\\tests\\data\\transform_test_data_<report_type>.json" for each project, then apply that JSON to the project for the specified report type.
3. Download the projects in Excel, then use the ``df`` fields from all the projects and the other field headings to create the relation named for the workbook in "\\tests\\data\\relations.py".
4. Escape the quotation marks (") within certain resource name values (replace ``"`` with ``/"``).

Create R5 SUSHI Response JSON Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. For each worksheet in "\\tests\\bin\\COUNTER_workbooks_for_tests\\" with an R5 report, load the worksheet into OpenRefine to create a project with a name that ends with an underscore and the two letter code for the type of report.
2. Apply "tests\\create_test_data\\prepare_dataframe_for_JSON_creation.json" to each of the projects created above.
3. Download each of the above projects in Excel and save to "\\tests\\bin\\workbooks_to_transform_into_JSONs\\" and adjust any pre-1900 publication dates if necessary (in creating test data, the date "1753-01-01" in OpenRefine became "-1" when exported to Excel, which in turn became Timestamp object with the value "1899-12-29" when the worksheet was uploaded).
4. For each type of report and vendor combination with a file in "\\tests\\bin\\workbooks_to_transform_into_JSONs\\", make a SUSHI API call in the browser, copy the result into a JSON file named with the statistics source ID, an underscore, and the report name abbreviation (the test data contains only one year of R5 reports, preventing repetitions with this naming convention) in the "\\tests\\data\\R5_COUNTER_JSONs_for_tests" folder.
5. In each newly created JSON file, anonymize the data in ``Report_Header``, change the ``Created`` value in ``Report_Header`` to ``2019-07-01T00:00:00Z``, and delete the data in ``Report_Items``.
6. Use each workbook in "\\tests\\bin\\workbooks_to_transform_into_JSONs\\" as input into "tests\\create_test_data\\create_R5_SUSHI_JSON_from_tabular_R5.py", then take the ``data`` section of the output JSON and copy it into the ``Report_Header`` section of the corresponding JSON in "\\tests\\data\\R5_COUNTER_JSONs_for_tests".
7. Unescape the slashes (/) in each JSON file via find and replace (replace ``\/`` with ``/``).

Create ``ConvertJSONDictToDataframe`` Test Fixtures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. For each report to be used in testing the ``ConvertJSONDictToDataframe`` class, either open the corresponding OpenRefine project modified by "tests\\create_test_data\\prepare_dataframe_for_JSON_creation.json" or load the Excel workbook from "\\tests\\bin\\workbooks_to_transform_into_JSONs\\" into OpenRefine.
2. Apply "tests\\create_test_data\\tabular_R5_to_dataframe.jsonc" to each project, remembering there's a manual step added via comment in the file.
3. Download each project in Excel, then use the ``df`` column for the data in the dataframe constructor in the appropriate fixture in "\\tests\\test_ConvertJSONDictToDataframe.py".

Create R5.1 Test Data
---------------------
Code of Practice 5.1 was released on 2023-05-05, featuring minor changes in the way the data is captured and a change to the JSON schema. The latter change required the creation of a second set of test data JSONs matching this new schema.

Create R5.1 SUSHI Response JSON Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. For each file in the "\\tests\\data\\R5_COUNTER_JSONs_for_tests" folder, create a copy in the "\\tests\\data\\R5.1_COUNTER_JSONs_for_tests" folder.
2. For each file in "\\tests\\data\\R5.1_COUNTER_JSONs_for_tests", make a SUSHI API call in the browser and copy the result into a JSON file with the relevant statistics source ID and report name abbreviation in the file name.
3. In each newly created JSON file, anonymize the data in ``Report_Header`` and change the ``Created`` value in ``Report_Header`` to ``2025-01-15T00:00:00Z``.
4. Remove data from the JSON files so only the resources matching the contents of the R5 JSONs remain, then change the usage numbers to anonymize the data.

Create ``ConvertJSONDictToDataframe`` Test Fixtures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. For each report to be used in testing the ``ConvertJSONDictToDataframe`` class, load the JSON into OpenRefine.
2. Use "tests\\create_test_data\\R5.1_JSON_to_dataframe.ipynb" to create the OpenRefine instructions JSON, then apply it to the OpenRefine project.
3. Download each project in Excel, then use the ``df`` column for the data in the dataframe constructor in the appropriate fixture in "\\tests\\test_ConvertJSONDictToDataframe.py"; remember to remove the statistics source ID and report type fields from the beginning and add the report creation date at the end.

Transaction Rollbacks
=====================
The preferred setup for testing database interactions involves performing all tests as transactions which are rolled back before the completion of the test suite; ideally, this configuration could also be used to accommodate the fact that certain test modules have preconditions involving data in some or all of the relations. To minimize the frequency of database resets during testing, the following order is recommended for running tests:

1. Tests loading data into a limited number of relations, after which the database must be cleared of data

  * ``test_app``

2. Tests loading data into all relations but ``COUNTERData``

  * ``test_bp_initialization``

3. Tests needing data in all relations but ``COUNTERData`` (works with SQL but not after above test)

  * ``test_bp_ingest_usage``

4. Tests needing all test data in all relations and/or capable of running with data in all relations (exact sequence below known to cause failures)

  * ``test_AnnualStatistics``
  * ``test_AnnualUsageCollectionTracking``
  * ``test_bp_annual_stats``
  * ``test_bp_login``
  * ``test_bp_view_lists``
  * ``test_bp_view_usage``
  * ``test_ConvertJSONDictToDataframe``
  * ``test_FiscalYears``
  * ``test_ResourceSources``
  * ``test_statements``
  * ``test_StatisticsSources``
  * ``test_SUSHICallAndResponse``
  * ``test_UploadCOUNTERReports``
  * ``test_Vendors``

SUSHI Variations
****************
Compliance to the SUSHI standard is often inexact, featuring differences people have no problem reconciling but that computers cannot match. To ensure adequate coverage of fringe cases during testing, statistics sources are listed below with the edge case situations they represent. The list is organized by statistics source to facilitate testing the ``SUSHICallAndResponse`` class; if a particular edge case needs to be tested, an appropriate statistics source can be found via search.

Internally Inconsistent
=======================
These vendors show internal inconsistencies in testing:

* Adam Matthew: ``status`` call always has a top-level ``Alerts`` key, but ``handle_SUSHI_exceptions`` isn't always called; calls made 11 minutes apart returning the exact same data can behave differently in regards to the method call

nginx Logging
*************
When a ``docker compose up`` command is used in the AWS instance to build and start the NoLCAT containers, the command line switches to showing a combined Python and nginx log. The nginx logging statements use the default log configuration, which has the structure ``$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$gzip_ratio"`` where

* **$remote_addr** is the client IP address
* **$remote_user**  is the username from the authentication
* **$time_local** is a timestamp in nginx's log format
* **$request** is the HTTP request start line, consisting of a HTTP method, the request target, and the HTTP version
* **$status** is the HTTP status code of the response
* **$body_bytes_sent** is the number of bytes sent to the client, not including the response header
* **$http_referer** is the address of the requested web page
* **$http_user_agent** is the value of the ``User Agent`` HTTP request field
* **$gzip_ratio** is the compression ratio achieved

In nginx logging statements, null values are represented by hyphens (``-``).
