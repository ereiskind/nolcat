                <li>Download <a href="{{ url_for('download_file', file_path=AUCT_file_path) }}">"initialize_annualUsageCollectionTracking.csv"</a>.</li>
                <li>Fill out the CSV from existing documentation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For statistics source and year combinations which don't exist (meaning either the statistics source didn't exist that year or no resource sources which used that statistics source were provided that year), delete the corresponding row in the CSV.</li>
                        <li>For statistics source and year combinations not requiring usage collection, set `usage_is_being_collected`, `manual_collection_required`, and `is_COUNTER_compliant` to false and choose the `collection_status` reflecting why usage doesn't need to be collected.</li>
                        <li>For statistics source and year combinations which had manually collected non-COUNTER compliant usage (including COUNTER R3 and earlier), set `usage_is_being_collected` and `manual_collection_required` to true, `is_COUNTER_compliant` to false, choose the appropriate `collection_status`, and prepare the usage statistics files:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Save the non-COUNTER files, ensuring that they're in one of the following formats:

                                <li>Save the reports in an Excel workbook where each sheet name is the abbreviation of the name of the report in that sheet.</li>
                                <li>Give the workbooks names that begin with the `statistics_source_ID` of the statistics source from which the usage came followed by an underscore.</li>
                                <li>For convenient loading later, place all the workbooks in a folder that contains nothing but these workbooks.</li>

                                <li>If some but not all of a statistics source and year combination's usage is COUNTER complaint, `is_COUNTER_compliant` is true.</li>
